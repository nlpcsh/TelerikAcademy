Task 13 - Describe the difference between C# and .NET Framework in 2-3 sentences.
- Write your description in a text file called “csharp-and-dot-net-framework.txt”. Use English.

C# - a multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines. It was developed by Microsoft within its .NET initiative. C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure.

.NET Framework - a proprietary, partially open source freeware software framework developed by Microsoft that runs primarily on Microsoft Windows. It includes a large class library known as Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides language interoperability (each language can use code written in other languages) across several programming languages. Programs written for .NET Framework execute in a software environment (as contrasted to hardware environment), known as Common Language Runtime (CLR), an application virtual machine that provides services such as security, memory management, and exception handling. FCL and CLR together constitute .NET Framework.
