Task 12 - Perform a research (e.g. in Google or Wikipedia) and provide a short list with popular development environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio.
- Write in a text file called “list-of-IDEs.txt” at least five IDEs along with 2-3 sentences about each of them. Use English.


Eclipse - The fundamentally modular nature of the Eclipse platform makes it easy to install additional features and plug-ins into an Eclipse based product, and to update the product's existing features and plug-ins. The Eclipse platform itself is structured as subsystems which are implemented in one or more plug-ins. The subsystems are built on top of a small runtime engine. Some of the advanages of it: 
- Language Extensibility are not limited and anyone is free to develop plug-ins for different languages and to make the development environment easier to use. Also, the ability to use this on Linux is a great sway for many people;
- It is free. 

Netbeans -  The NetBeans Platform is a generic framework for Swing applications. It provides the "plumbing" that, before, every developer had to write themselves—saving state, connecting actions to menu items, toolbar items and keyboard shortcuts; window management, and so on.
The NetBeans Platform provides all of these out of the box. It gives you a time-tested architecture for free. An architecture that encourages sustainable development practices. Because the NetBeans Platform architecture is modular, it's easy to create applications that are robust and extensible.

EDE (Emacs Development Environment) - generic interface for managing projects. It can manage or create user's makefiles and other building environment duties. It specifies a single set of menus and keybindings, while supporting multiple ways to express a project via a build system. In EDE, a project hierarchy matches a directory hierarchy. The project's topmost directory is called the project root, and its subdirectories are subprojects. Each project can contain multiple targets. A target, at the simplest level, is a named collection of files within a project. EDE provides a way for other tools to easily learn file associations. It is free (Under the GNU GPL).

Aptana Studio - oriented to web and scripting languages as PHP, Ruby on Rails, and Python. The studio itself is available as a plugin for Eclipse if the user prefers the way Aptana handles his/hers work and want to combine it with a more comprehensive IDE. It is free and available solely under the GNU General Public License.

Code::Blocs - is a free C, C++ and Fortran IDE built to meet the most demanding needs of its users. It is designed to be very extensible and fully configurable. Built around a plugin framework, Code::Blocks can be extended with plugins. Any kind of functionality can be added by installing/coding a plugin. Runs on Linux, Mac and Windows.
