# Structural Patterns
----
#### Problem
> Structural patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.Structural class patterns use inheritance to compose inter faces or implementations. As a simple example, consider how
multiple inheritance mixes two or more classes into one. The result is a class that combines the properties of its parent classes. This pattern is particularly useful for making independently developed class libraries work together.

> Rather than composing interfaces or implementations, structural object patterns describe ways to compose objects to realize new functionality. The added
flexibility of object composition comes from the ability to change the composition at run-time, which is impossible with static class composition.


## `Adapter`

#### Intent
Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

#### Motivation

#### Applicability
Use it when:

* you want to use an existing class, and its interface does not match the one you need.
* you want to create a reusable class that cooperates with unrelated or unforeseen classes, that is, classes that don't necessarily have compatible interfaces.
* (object adapter only) you need to use several existing subclasses, but it's impractical to adapt their interface by subclassing every one. An object adapter can adapt the interface of its parent class.

#### Consequences
Class and object adapters have different trade-offs. A **class** adapter

* adapts Adaptee to Target by committing to a concrete Adapter class. As a consequence, a class adapter won't work when we want to adapt a class and all its subclasses.
* lets Adapter override some of Adaptee's behavior, since Adapter is a subclass of Adaptee.
* introduces only one object, and no additional pointer indirection is needed to get to the adaptee.

An **object** adapter:

* lets a single Adapter work with many Adaptees â€” that is, the Adaptee itself and all of its subclasses (if any). The Adapter can also add functionality to all Adaptees at once.
* makes it harder to override Adaptee behavior. It will require subclassing Adaptee and making Adapter refer to the subclass rather than the Adaptee itself.

#### Related Patterns
**Bridge** has a structure similar to an object adapter, but Bridge has a different intent: It is meant to separate an interface from its implementation so that they can be varied easily and independently. An adapter is meant to change the interface of an existing object.

**Decorator** enhances another object without changing its interface. A decorator is thus more transparent to the application than an adapter is. As a consequence, Decorator supports recursive composition, which isn't possible with pure adapters.

**Proxy** defines a representative or surrogate for another object and does not change its interface.

## `Bridge`

#### Intent
Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

#### Motivation
When an abstraction can have one of several possible implementations, the usual way to accommodate them is to use inheritance. An abstract class defines the interface to the abstraction, and concrete subclasses implement it in different ways. But this approach isn't always flexible enough. Inheritance binds an implementation to the abstraction permanently, which makes it difficult to modify, extend, and reuse abstractions and implementations independently.

#### Applicability
* you want to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation. This might be the case, for example, when the implementation must be selected or switched at run-time.
* both the abstractions and their implementations should be extensible by subclassing. In this case, the Bridge pattern lets you combine the different abstractions and implementations and extend them independently.
* changes in the implementation of an abstraction should have no impact on clients; that is, their code should not have to be recompiled.
* you have a proliferation of classes. Such a class hierarchy indicates the need for splitting an object into two parts.
* you want to share an implementation among multiple objects (perhaps using reference counting), and this fact should be hidden from the client.

#### Consequences
* Decoupling interface and implementation. An implementation is not bound permanently to an interface. The implementation of an abstraction can be configured at run-time. It's even possible for an object to change its
implementation at run-time.
* Improved extensibility. You can extend the Abstraction and Implementor hierarchies independently.
* Hiding implementation details from clients. You can shield clients from implementation details, like the sharing of implementor objects and the accompanying reference count mechanism (if any)

#### Related Patterns
An **Abstract Factory** can create and configure a particular Bridge.
The **Adapter** pattern is geared toward making unrelated classes work together. It is usually applied to systems after they're designed. Bridge, on the other hand, is used up-front in a design to let abstractions and implementations vary independently.


## `Composite`

#### Intent
Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

#### Motivation
Graphics applications like drawing editors and schematic capture systems let users build complex diagrams out of simple components. The user can group components to form larger components, which in turn can be grouped to form still larger components. A simple implementation could define classes for graphical primitives such as Text and Lines plus other classes that act as containers for these
primitives.

But there's a problem with this approach: Code that uses these classes must treat primitive and container objects differently, even if most of the time the user
treats them identically. Having to distinguish these objects makes the application more complex. The Composite pattern describes how to use recursive composition so that clients don't have to make this distinction.

The key to the Composite pattern is an abstract class that represents both primitives and their containers. For the graphics system, this class is Graphic. Graphic declares operations like Draw that are specific to graphical objects. It also declares operations that all composite objects share, such as operations for accessing and managing its children.


#### Applicability
* you want to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects.
* you want clients to be able to ignore the difference between compositions of objects and individual objects. Clients will treat all objects in the composite structure uniformly.

#### Consequences
* defines class hierarchies consisting of primitive objects and composite objects. Primitive objects can be composed into more complex objects, which in turn can be composed, and so on recursively. Wherever client code expects a primitive object, it can also take a composite object.
* makes the client simple. Clients can treat composite structures and individual objects uniformly. Clients normally don't know (and shouldn't care) whether they're dealing with a leaf or a composite component. This simplifies client code, because it avoids having to write
tag-and-case-statement-style functions over the classes that define the composition.
* makes it easier to add new kinds of components. Newly defined Composite or Leaf subclasses work automatically with existing structures and client code. Clients don't have to be changed for new Component classes.
* can make your design overly general. The disadvantage of making it easy to add new components is that it makes it harder to restrict the components of a composite. Sometimes you want a composite to have only certain
components. With Composite, you can't rely on the type system to enforce those constraints for you. You'll have to use run-time checks instead.

#### Related Patterns
Often the component-parent link is used for a **Chain of Responsibility**.

**Decorator** is often used with Composite. When decorators and composites are used together, they will usually have a common parent class. So decorators will
have to support the Component interface with operations like Add, Remove, and GetChild.

**Flyweight** lets you share components, but they can no longer refer to their parents.

**Iterator** can be used to traverse composites.

**Visitor** localizes operations and behavior that would otherwise be distributed across Composite and Leaf classes.


## `Decorator`

#### Intent
Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

#### Motivation
Sometimes we want to add responsibilities to individual objects, not to an entire class.

One way to add responsibilities is with inheritance. Inheriting a border from another class puts a border around every subclass instance. This is inflexible,
however, because the choice of border is made statically. A client can't control how and when to decorate the component with a border.

A more flexible approach is to enclose the component in another object that adds the border. The enclosing object is called a **decorator**. The decorator conforms to the interface of the component it decorates so that its presence is transparent to the component's clients. The decorator forwards requests to the component and may perform additional actions (such as drawing a border) before or after forwarding. Transparency lets you nest decorators recursively, thereby allowing an unlimited number of added responsibilities.

#### Applicability
* to add responsibilities to individual objects dynamically and transparently, that is, without affecting other objects.
* for responsibilities that can be withdrawn.
* when extension by subclassing is impractical. Sometimes a large number of independent extensions are possible and would produce an explosion of subclasses to support every combination. Or a class definition may be hidden or otherwise unavailable for subclassing.

#### Consequences
* More flexibility than static inheritance. The Decorator pattern provides a more flexible way to add  responsibilities to objects than can be had with static (multiple) inheritance. With decorators, responsibilities can be added and removed at run-time simply by attaching and detaching them.
* Avoids feature-laden classes high up in the hierarchy. Decorator offers a pay-as-you-go approach to adding responsibilities. Instead of trying to support all foreseeable features in a complex, customizable class, you can define a simple class and add functionality incrementally with Decorator objects. 
* A decorator and its component aren't identical. A decorator acts as a transparent enclosure. But from an object identity point of view, a decorated component is not identical to the component itself.
* Lots of little objects. A design that uses Decorator often results in systems composed of lots of little objects that all look alike. The objects differ only in the way they are interconnected, not in their class or in the value of their variables.

#### Related Patterns
**Adapter**: A decorator is different from an adapter in that a decorator only changes an object's  responsibilities, not its interface an adapter will give
an object a completely new interface.

**Composite**: A decorator can be viewed as a degenerate composite with only one component. However, a decorator adds additional responsibilities â€” it isn't intended for object aggregation.

**Strategy**: A decorator lets you change the skin of an object, a strategy lets you change the guts. These are two alternative ways of changing an object.


## `Facade`

#### Intent
Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

#### Motivation
Structuring a system into subsystems helps reduce complexity. A common design goal is to minimize the communication and dependencies between subsystems. One way to achieve this goal is to introduce a facade object that provides a single, simplified interface to the more general facilities of a subsystem.

#### Applicability
* you want to provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem. A facade can provide a simple default view of the subsystem that is good enough for most clients. Only clients needing more customizability will need to look beyond the facade.
* there are many dependencies between clients and the implementation classes of an abstraction. Introduce a facade to decouple the subsystem from clients and other subsystems, thereby promoting subsystem independence and
portability. 
* you want to layer your subsystems. Use a facade to define an entry point to each subsystem level. If  subsystems are dependent, then you can simplify the dependencies between them by making them communicate with each other solely through their facades.

#### Consequences
1. It shields clients from subsystem components, thereby reducing the number of objects that clients deal with and making the subsystem easier to use.
2. It promotes weak coupling between the subsystem and its clients. Often the components in a subsystem are strongly coupled. Weak coupling lets you vary the components of the subsystem without affecting its clients.
3. It doesn't prevent applications from using subsystem classes if they need to. Thus you can choose between ease of use and generality.

#### Related Patterns
**Abstract Factory** can be used with Facade to provide an interface for creating subsystem objects in a subsystem-independent way. Abstract Factory can also be used as an alternative to Facade to hide platform-specific classes.

**Mediator** is similar to Facade in that it abstracts functionality of existing classes. However, Mediator's purpose is to abstract arbitrary communication between colleague objects, often centralizing functionality that doesn't belong in any one of them. A mediator's colleagues are aware of and communicate with the mediator instead of communicating with each other directly. In contrast, a
facade merely abstracts the interface to subsystem objects to make them easier to use; it doesn't define new functionality, and subsystem classes don't know about it.

Usually only one Facade object is required. Thus Facade objects are often **Singletons**.


## `Flyweight`

#### Intent
Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.

#### Motivation
Some applications could benefit from using objects throughout their design, but a naive implementation would be prohibitively expensive.

#### Applicability
Apply the Flyweight pattern when all of the following are true:

* An application uses a large number of objects.
* Storage costs are high because of the sheer quantity of objects.
* Most object state can be made extrinsic.
* Many groups of objects may be replaced by relatively few shared objects once extrinsic state is removed.
* The application doesn't depend on object identity. Since flyweight objects may be shared, identity tests will return true for conceptually distinct
objects.

#### Consequences
Flyweights may introduce run-time costs associated with transferring, finding, and/or computing extrinsic state, especially if it was formerly stored as intrinsic state. However, such costs are offset by space savings, which increase as more flyweights are shared.

#### Related Patterns
The Flyweight pattern is often combined with the **Composite** pattern to implement a logically hierarchical structure in terms of a directed-acyclic graph with shared leaf nodes.

It's often best to implement **State** and **Strategy** objects as flyweights.


## `Proxy`

#### Intent
Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

#### Motivation
One reason for controlling access to an object is to defer the full cost of its creation and initialization until we actually need to use it. 

#### Applicability
1. A remote proxy provides a local representative for an object in a different address space. 
2. A virtual proxy creates expensive objects on demand. 
3. A protection proxy controls access to the original object. Protection proxies are useful when objects should have different access rights.
4. A smart reference is a replacement for a bare pointer that performs additional actions when an object is accessed. Typical uses include: 
 * counting the number of references to the real object so that it can be freed automatically when there are no more references; 
 * loading a persistent object into memory when it's first referenced;
 * checking that the real object is locked before it's accessed to ensure that no other object can change it.

#### Consequences
1. A remote proxy can hide the fact that an object resides in a different address space.
2. A virtual proxy can perform optimizations such as creating an object on demand.
3. Both protection proxies and smart references allow additional housekeeping tasks when an object is accessed.

#### Related Patterns

**Adapter**: An adapter provides a different interface to the object it adapts. In contrast, a proxy provides the same interface as its subject. However, a proxy used for access protection might refuse to perform an operation that the subject will perform, so its interface may be effectively a subset of the subject's.

**Decorator**: Although decorators can have similar implementations as proxies, decorators have a different purpose. A decorator adds one or more responsibilities to an object, whereas a proxy controls access to an object.

#### Examples

1. An object, such as a large image, takes a long time to load.
2. The results of a computation take a long time to complete, and you need to display intermediate results while the computation continues.
3. The object is on a remote machine, and loading it over the network may be slow, especially during peak network load periods.
4. The object has limited access rights, and the proxy can validate the access permissions for that user.
